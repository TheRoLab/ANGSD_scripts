These files are often in .R format, but may contain snippets of code to be used in bash, depending on the application.

Check out [ANGSD's website](http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/Main_Page) for instructions on how to run ANGSD, and these tutorials [1](https://github.com/mfumagalli/ngsTools/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md) & [2](https://arundurvasula.wordpress.com/2015/02/08/pca-with-angsd-and-ngscovar/). Between those and [ANGSD wrapper](https://github.com/mojaveazure/angsd-wrapper), you should have most things covered.
